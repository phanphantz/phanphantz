 ## Open-Source Projects
This section features all of my open-source projects, primarily Unity-based tools that I’ve developed and actively use in both personal and freelance projects.

### GameDevSecretSauce
These are the tools and game development materials I share on [น้ำจิ้มสูตรลับของนักพัฒนาเกม](https://www.facebook.com/GameDevSecretSauce/). It's a Facebook page dedicated to providing valuable knowledge and techniques for Thai game developers.
- [**Thai Font Doctor**](https://github.com/phanphantz/GameDevSecretSauce/tree/main/ThaiFontDoctor) - An Editor Tool for solving Thai font's vowel and tone mark issues in just minutes! It automates glyph pair adjustments within TextMeshPro's Font Asset, transforming a tedious process into a quick and effortless task.
- [**Google Sheet Downloader**](https://github.com/phanphantz/GameDevSecretSauce/tree/main/GoogleSheetDownloader) - A Helper script for downloading a private Google sheet as a serializable data list using Google Sheet API v.4

### PhEngine Packages
A collection of Unity Editor Tool packages I’ve developed to address various aspects of game development.
- [**PhEngine - Core**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-Core) - A Core package that provides essential components for other packages and includes commonly used utility classes.
  - Include useful stuff like Singletions, Service Locator, JSON Tools, and Logger
  - Features **Operations**, a custom coroutine wrapper inspired by DOTween and UniTask. It allows users to bind callbacks to coroutine-like operations and manage them easily with control functions like Pause, Resume, Cancel, and more. All operations can also be chained together as a series or parallel calls.
 
- [**PhEngine - Network**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-Network) - My version of RESTful API connector for developing online games
  - All APIs are treated as ScriptableObjects, making it easy to customize each endpoint's behavior, such as configuring error handling methods.
  - Supports API calls as Coroutines or UniTasks (using the async-await pattern).
  - Includes features like callback bindings, error handling, environment switching, and data center patterns.
  - Test any API directly from the ScriptableObject by specifying the JSON body and clicking the test button.
  - Easily disable any API and mock API responses as either failed or successful with mock data.
  - Provides insightful logging with four modes: Pretty, Verbose, Minimal, and None.
  
- [**PhEngine - Thai Text**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-ThaiText) - A package contains useful tools for handling Thai text in Unity
  - ThaiTextMeshPro components for displaying Thai font correctly using [ThaiFontAdjustor](https://github.com/SaladLab/Unity3D.ThaiFontAdjuster)
  - A Unity supported version of [ThaiStringTokenizer](https://github.com/chaiwatmat/ThaiStringTokenizer) library for dictionary-based word wrapping.
  
- [**PhEngine - UI**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-UI) - My UI engine for managing UI Panels, UI Layers, and Transitions.
- [**PhEngine - Motion**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-Motion) - A Scriptable Animation Config solution that allows you to reuse Animations and Tweens in the form of ScriptableObjects. Similar concept to **DOTweenPro.**
- [**PhEngine - Sound**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-Sound) - A sound engine. Modified from [EazySoundManager](https://github.com/JackM36/Eazy-Sound-Manager)
- [**PhEngine - Scene**](https://github.com/phanphantz/PhEngine-Scene) - A scene management package based on **SceneReference.**

### Miscellaneous
- [**Content Size Fitter With Limit**](https://github.com/phanphantz/Unity3D.ContentSizeFitterWithLimit)
- [**National Election 2023 Top-Down Voting Unit Structures**](https://github.com/phanphantz/th-vote-66-top-down-structures)
